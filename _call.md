## WILU 2021: Visions of the Possible  
>(Halifax-K’jipuktuk NS-based, online June 17-25, 2021)

### Turning Up the Volume: An updated call for presentations from Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPOC) colleagues.

The Libraries at Dalhousie, Mount Saint Vincent, and Saint Mary’s Universities are looking forward to hosting **WILU 2021: Visions of the Possible**. This is Canada's premier (and first-time online) conference on information literacy and library instruction. We had a successful call last year, but transitioning to an online model has provided us an opportunity to do further planning.

Academic institutions, including libraries, continue to fall short with representing our diverse communities. The academic environment continues to favour white people, as they hold the majority of academic roles, positions of power, and decision-making capabilities. The WILU 2021 Steering Committee has reflected on and discussed the outcomes of these imbalances. One change going forward is a new call for presentations from our BIPOC colleagues. The WILU Steering Committee believes that it is crucial to augment, amplify, and honour these voices. Therefore, we are adding space to our program, to ensure that our conference is more inclusive.

The WILU 2021 Programming Committee is now inviting proposal submissions from BIPOC library professionals. Speakers may report on original research, completed projects, instructional programs, innovative projects, or other information literacy initiatives. Discussions of pedagogy, learning theory, and educational philosophy are also acceptable. Participants may represent diverse experiences or points of view. Please consider submitting a proposal for one of the following types of online sessions:

- Presentation (30-minute session)
- Panel discussion (45-minute session)

**Review of proposals will begin on December 18, 2021**. Please use the [online submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjIQk5AKI7emJ3GI0KY2gORZgK_6ovkhS1J2wqY0Ma_I6yAQ/viewform) to provide your presentation title and description, abstract and speaker information.

### WILU 2020 Theme: Visions of the Possible

Teaching is, in part, about asking questions. Thoughtful teaching considers questions like “what is happening in this classroom?” and “what works in helping students learn?” “Visions of the possible,” a phrase borrowed from the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)[^1], goes further and asks us to ponder “what if?” and avoid making assumptions. Visions of the possible anticipate surprise and embrace the unexpected nature of some of teaching's most important outcomes.

Looking ahead to what might be possible means building on what we do best. Our past and current practices are the foundation from which we build, innovate, and create. To envision the possible, we also draw on the past to reflect, critique, and improve upon the present. What can we envision for the future of information literacy and library instruction? Where have your visions led you? How have your experiences clarified your vision? WILU 2021 invites you to share the practical and applied, theoretical and philosophical possibilities in information literacy.
