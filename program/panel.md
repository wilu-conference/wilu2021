### Student-Led Action Towards Racial Inclusion and Equity: The Trajectory of the University of Toronto's iSchool Diversity Working Group

#### Oy Lein Jace Harrison, Lorena Almaraz De La Garza & Lo Humeniuk

This presentation and panel discussion will explore student initiatives surrounding racial inclusion and equity at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information, highlighting the work of past students and outlining the challenges of passing on institutional memory to future cohorts. We’ll look specifically at the events of the summer of 2020, and how a student-led protest fueled by anti-Black racism reflected the complex political and social climate of anti-Black racism protests across the world, marked by the murder of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless others. Student efforts and collaboration among the various student groups at the University of Toronto iSchool resulted in a petition and a survey, the results of which were showcased in <a href="https://9b7f3cfc-e62d-4254-b16d-547c12c40e17.filesusr.com/ugd/f30269_cf066052fed748b780923c7e85807c0b.pdf?index=true" target="blank">A Report on Diversity and Inclusion Experiences at the Faculty of Information</a>. Student work continues to build community and fill gaps at the Faculty, and consequently, we will discuss results, small victories, how we work to keep our institution accountable, and current work being done to support and better reflect a diversity of students and faculty members at the iSchool. With this, we hope to encourage other affinity-based groups to organize and take action.
