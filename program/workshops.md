### <a name="workshop-1"></a>WORKSHOP 1 | Getting Started with the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning: A Workshop to Discover What is Possible

#### Lauren Hays   
One of the best ways to inform teaching and learning is by asking questions, and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) helps instructors do just that. SoTL is a movement in higher education to study teaching and learning in order to improve both. SoTL continues to grow internationally and has recently gained momentum in librarianship. As librarians and information literacy professionals, there is much we can learn from engaging with SoTL. We also have much to contribute.

The goals of this pre-conference are for attendees to:

1.	Determine why SoTL is a good fit for the study of information literacy,
2.	Identify what they can do with SoTL,
3.	Decide how they wish to engage with SoTL,
4.	Brainstorm SoTL questions,
5.	Create an action plan for a SoTL project.

Through active learning exercises, attendees will use a project planning toolkit to create an action plan for a SoTL project. Workshop attendees will engage in discussions that focus on their local teaching context and how that context impacts the SoTL work they wish to do. With a focus on asking good questions, attendees will consider teaching and learning phenomena they are curious about and what SoTL questions they want to ask to help them gain insight into their own teaching and their students’ learning. Attendees will also identify potential collaborators, brainstorm ideas for a research design, and determine how best to engage with SoTL. Attendees will leave the session with concrete ideas for moving forward with their own SoTL project.

### <a name="workshop-2"></a>WORKSHOP 2 | Teaching Philosophies and Dossiers for Librarians: Providing Evidence of Effective Practice

#### Betsy Keating & Dr. Margie Clow Bohan  
Librarians are educators. Yet many administrators are unaware of—or underrate—librarians’ instructional practice, their skills, and their ongoing professional development as educators. Teaching Dossiers and Teaching Philosophies tell the story of teaching accomplishments and offer insights and evidence about instructional practice in a way that CVs cannot. They are widely used for hiring and promotion in colleges and universities, but until recently, librarians have not been called upon to produce teaching dossiers. Dossiers and philosophy statements are valuable documents for administrators and selection committees, but the experience of writing and curating these documents is equally valuable for the librarians who create them.

This workshop will be an opportunity for each participant to begin creating and arranging a personal teaching dossier, along with its integral teaching philosophy statement. A standard dossier template will be introduced, we’ll discuss some variations and their purposes, and we’ll explore what’s involved in writing a teaching philosophy statement. Participants will begin planning and arranging their dossiers and evidence. There will also be time dedicated to writing: describing experiences, skills, and approaches to teaching, as well as opportunities for feedback and discussion with colleagues. During this workshop, participants will:

- become familiar with (or review) the structure and purposes of a teaching dossier.
- begin to write (or refine a draft of) a teaching philosophy statement.
- plan the arrangement of evidence about their teaching practices.
- outline their dossier contents and begin to write essential narratives about their teaching responsibilities.

### <a name="workshop-3"></a>WORKSHOP 3 | Lower the Barriers - An Introduction to LibGuide and Website Accessibility

#### Lisa Snider  
The first point of contact for many people with libraries is often a LibGuide and/or website. One in three Nova Scotians identifies as having at least one disability. These current, and potential, library users with disabilities need accessible digital materials, such as websites and LibGuides. Making these digital materials more accessible is even more crucial today, because many have to rely on the digital realm, due to COVID-19 restrictions.  

This workshop will provide basic information to start the journey of lowering online barriers. It will focus on:
- *Nova Scotia’s Digital Accessibility* related legislation and impact
- The range of diverse users and different technologies  
- How people are accessing your digital materials (with live demos of technologies)
- Tips you can use right away to make content, navigation, design and layout more accessible for all users.
- Key resources for LibGuide accessibility.
- No technical expertise is required, just an interest in the subject.

### <a name="workshop-4"></a>WORKSHOP 4 | Librarians and Open Educational Resources: Users, Adapters, and Creators

#### Lindsey MacCallum  
Open Educational Resources (OER) are increasingly being recognized as essential to equity-based pedagogical practice. Both novices and experts in OER will benefit from this workshop, which will turn the lens on librarians as creators of teaching and learning materials and discuss various options and opportunities for sharing our work. The workshop will provide a foundation of knowledge about Open Educational Resources for library instructors and will guide participants step-by-step through the theoretical and practical considerations involved in creating OER. Topics will include copyright licenses, formatting, embedding interactivity, dissemination, and OER as pedagogy. Participants will come away from the workshop with the knowledge and skills needed to make their teaching and learning material freely available on a global scale.

Workshop participants are asked to attend the session with an assignment/activity/exercise they've created and/or adapted.
