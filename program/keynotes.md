#### Teaching as though what mattered most was our learning
In this session, Kim Brooks takes on the hard question of what the university would look like if what we cared about most was learning:  our own and our students’.  Most of us are so pressed by the daily demands of our jobs – real or perceived – that we forget what motivated us to work in a university setting. This session is designed to remind us of our energetic, earlier selves and to connect each of us with our inner student.

#### Counter-narratives in Teaching Librarianship
Critical Race Theory teaches us that stories matter. They are both informed by lived experience and created to influence reality. This talk will examine teaching librarianship through the stories we tell ourselves, the narratives we believe to be true, and the power of counter-narratives in creating positive change. Together we’ll explore possible counter-narratives in teaching librarianship and how they can transform our work and experiences, as well as those of our students and colleagues.
