The WILU Planning Team is dedicated to providing a positive event experience for all participants, and expects host institutions, volunteers, attendees, and speakers to show respect and courtesy toward one another at all conference events. We value ideas, thoughts, and expression, and we appreciate new pedagogy when delivering workshops and sessions. Discriminatory language and imagery are not appropriate for any WILU event venue, keynotes, workshops, or sessions.

## Conduct During the Conference

The WILU Planning Team does not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment is understood as any behaviour that threatens another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment. It includes (but is not limited to) offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Please remember that harassment is subjectively experienced, and that it is not the intention behind the action that matters but the impact of the action.

### Bystander Intervention

In the unfortunate event that WILU 2021 participants witness any racist, sexist, ableist or other discriminatory behaviour, we ask that they consider their role as bystanders and feel empowered to respond in a way that positively influences the outcome.
If at any time a participant feels that they have been harassed or that this code of conduct has been breached, it is important that the participant report the incident to a member of the WILU Planning Team (see the reporting section on this page).

### Mindful Social Media

The WILU Planning Team asks that all participants be mindful of their social media use while at WILU 2021. If you are planning on taking photos, screen captures, or videos while at WILU 2021, please ask permission of attendees and session presenters before posting or tagging photos that may be identifying or contain potentially sensitive information.

## Reporting Process

If you need to report a Code of Conduct violation, you may:

- Submit your report via an [online form](https://forms.office.com/r/fNJ7MikNKB).
- Contact us via the Conference email: <{{ site.email }}>

Reach out directly to a member of the Code of Conduct Committee:

- Melissa Helwig, Dalhousie University, she/their, <melissa.helwig@dal.ca>
- Deborah Hemming, Dalhousie University, she/her, <deborah.hemming@dal.ca>
- Lindsey MacCallum, Mount Saint Vincent University, she/her, <lindsey.maccallum@msvu.ca>
- Denyse Rodrigues, Mount Saint Vincent University, she/their, <denyse.rodrigues@msvu.ca>

### Complaint Process

A Code of Conduct Committee member will contact the alleged violator as soon as possible. Once the alleged violator has been contacted, the Code of Conduct Committee member will:

- Relay the details of the complaint, without identifying the complainant.
- Provide or link to a copy of the Code of Conduct and procedure and identify the behaviour that prompted the complaint.
- Record the alleged violator’s response to the complaint.
- Meeting of the Code of Conduct Committee

The Code of Conduct Committee will review the matter as soon as possible. If the Committee agrees that the behaviour constituted a violation of the Code of Conduct, they will also decide upon the sanction to apply, based on the severity of the incident. Sanctions may include:

- Warning with notice of further sanctions if the behaviour continues.
- Advise violator to seek no further contact with the person who has lodged the complaint (providing the complainant has not requested anonymity).
- Removal of formal role associated with the event  (if the person is a volunteer, speaker, etc.) but permission to stay.
- Removal from the event.
- After the Committee has come to an agreement, up to two representatives will be tasked with communicating directly with the alleged violator to inform them of the committee's decision and any associated sanctions.

The Code of Conduct representative will not facilitate or relay any apologies or messages from the alleged violator or attempt to mediate a difference of opinion.

WILU 2021 Conference Code of Conduct incidents may be reported by direct message or email to the Code of Conduct Committee or online by completing the [WILU 2021 Conference Code of Conduct Incident Reporting Form](https://forms.office.com/r/fNJ7MikNKB).

All measures will be taken to protect the identity of the reporting participant and prevent retaliation. If the report is made against a WILU Planning Team or Code of Conduct member, they will not be involved in the resolution.
